                        <p>My motivation to study law and become a lawyer stems for my deep childhood desire for a more just and equal society. Growing up on the Eastern slopes of Mount Kenya in a rural village was fun. Life was nice and simple. Walking
                            to and from school with other girls and boys, coming home for lunch and back to school for the afternoon session was all fun and relaxed.<br></p>
                        <p>I was only bothered by the apparent disparity between the kids from the poor and those from the more well - to- do families. I came from the latter sort of family, with parents who were initially teachers but had risen through
                            the career ladder to become a public administrator (dad) and a social worker (mum).&nbsp;My sister and l shared what we could with our needy friends, including our extra clothes and shoes.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    years old that l would be a lawyer. She said lawyers concern themselves with people with problems, and look for ways to help&nbsp;them out. Deal done- l was going to be a lawyer. Thankfully, I became one.<br></p>

                                <p>Representing clients in court for ten straight years did not give me the satisfaction l was looking for. So, my search started all over again, and it got me branch off into constructive conflict resolution. I became a lawyer
                                    who focuses on mediation, conflict resolution and peace practice. My Master of Arts degree in Peace Studies and International Relations gave me critical insights on how to become good at this. I am fulfilled. I love
